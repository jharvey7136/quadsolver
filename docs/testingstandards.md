### Testing Standards

Support for unit testing and full system testing. Also tests for NaNs, INFs, and float-precision. Unit tests simply tests one part, or one function, of the program. There is no logic in the tests.

Full system tests run and test the entirety of the program, comparing the programs answers to hard-coded, known correct answers.
